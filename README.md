### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋👋👋

I am a technical writer based in Seattle, Washington.   💻 ✏️  

Pronouns: He/him/his  😄  

I'm currently working on creating API documentation and user guides for my technical writing portfolio.  🔭  

I’m looking to collaborate with software engineers who have created tech tools and would like some help writing documentation. If you're interested, send me a message on LinkedIn!  👯
